# Sprite Sheeter
A program for creating large images (sheets) made out of smaller images (sprites) laid out in a grid. This process is called "Sprite sheeting" and is a common way of viewing animations of 2D video game characters.

Sprite Sheeter is a GUI program created to more easily facilitate this sprite sheet creation process, rather than just using Paint or GIMP or Photoshop to manually sheet sprites.
