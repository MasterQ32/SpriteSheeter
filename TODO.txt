Current technical tasks:
-Re-add functionality while removing code
-Use actual item methods now for mouseover testing

UI Design Stories:
-Rework frame movement/editing:
	-Clicking frames in a sheet should outline
	-Outlined frames can be click-dragged to move
	-Can ctrl/shift-click other frames and move/delete/etc
-Rework animation movement/editing:
	-Clicking animations should outline/select
	-Can click-drag animations around and between each other
-Option for minimizing sheet width/user specifying sheet width
	-Sheet width box should snap to even values, rather than spinning by one pixel at a time
-Rework upper toolbar; delete animations/frames in batches
-Minimum width for sheet for dragging sheet width bar

Technical Stories:
-Refactor MainWindow.cpp and split into subclasses as needed
	-Default w/h of balance window shouldn't be handled by MainWindow
-Re-add balance/resize
-Rather than specifying image types manually, remove filter entirely or add ALL actual file types we support to filter
-More robust undo/redo system (current brute force approach is super slow)
	-Abstract undo/redo class 
	-Everything that can be undone/redone has instantiation
	-Two stacks for undo/redo; clear redo stack when pushing onto undo stack

-Commandline argument support?

User stories:
-Test balance/resize; reports of crashing
-Arrange whole animation strips, perhaps via click first frame + Shift-click last frame + drag and drop? If not, clicking a row and using arrow buttons would suffice. (Current workaround: Use animation arrows)
-Being able to drag labels around
	-May want to think about labels being individual items rather than part of an animation
	-Along that note, custom labels/watermarks is common on TSR sheets
-Scroll sheet view when clicking and dragging frames around, particularly when zoomed in. For sheets that are long enough to where you have to zoom out a lot, this becomes necessary. (Current workaround: Shift-mousewheel)
-Being able to "anchor" frames by their bottoms instead of them all floating top-most within a strip where it's possible. This would make for a cleaner and frankly more accurate arrangement of animation frames in some instances. (Current workaround: balance animation)
-When I load lots of images (mainly that amount to a large sheet) it works fine but other times, loading... not the whole set at once, but in parts, causes it to freeze and crash.
	-See if image loading logic can be threaded or otherwise optimized to prevent all image loading on the main thread, causing UI hangs
-When a whole string/"animation" of sprites has been moved, the label gets removed instead of being carried along with it.
	-Might be a non-issue if moving animations as a whole? Should blank animations be allowed?
-Dragging the boundaries of a sheet to be too horizontally thin kind of causes it to spaz out.
-The "maximum sheet width" doesn't seem to settle on an exact dimensions when dragging and resizing a sheet. On that note, a suggestion to perhaps display sheet height as well?
	-Revisit workflow of optimal width/height vs. user-specified
-Could we please be able to drag sprites in-between others on the Y axis? If you load sprites in the incorrect order there's basically no way to move things up and down (dragging them to the bottom and then moving up also doesn't work if the place you want to move them to isn't the very bottom).
	-Insert new animations above and in between others rather than just at the bottom of the sheet
-Shift + click to select multiple frames for deleting/moving
-Figure out weird image formats in images Mighty Jetters uploaded, and see if my fault and/or can be fixed or not
-Offset frames by a few pixels l/r/u/d; not to be confused with moving frames around in an animation
-Drag-and-drop should support .sheet file format
-Ctrl-Z appears to not work
