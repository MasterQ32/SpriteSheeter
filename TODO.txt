v1.0:
-Test imageformats to see if they're needed for .jpeg and such
-Better responsiveness when click-dragging frames


Other misc TODO:
-Animations extracted to their own class and rendered separately from one another
-Threaded rendering of animations
-Add debug log & test balance/resize; reports of crashing
-Offset frames by a few pixels l/r/u/d; not to be confused with moving frames around in an animation
-Rather than specifying image types manually, remove filter entirely or add ALL actual file types we support
-Update file case in repo
-Default w/h of balance window shouldn't be handled by MainWindow
-Commandline argument support
-Official thread link in about dialog
