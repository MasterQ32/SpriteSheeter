Current technical tasks:
-Re-add functionality while removing code

UI Design Stories:
-Rework frame movement/editing:
	-Only select multiple frames on ctrl-click 
	-Deselect all frames by clicking on anim/off sheet
	-Shift-click to select frames in a row
	-Click-drag in box to select multiple frames
-Rework animation movement/editing:
	-Clicking animations should outline/select
	-Can click-drag animations around and between each other
-Rework upper toolbar; delete animations/frames in batches
-Add cut/copy/paste
	-frames will need a deep copy function
	-Paste deselects everything else
-Add save/cut/copy/paste/etc buttons to upper toolbar
-Save/Save As disabled in main menu and toolbar when new file/not saveable
-Make Play & Pause buttons the same button
-Remove stop button?
-Update prev/next frame button icons to better fit with icon style of row
-Add support to autocrop frames in an animation to remove whitespace (while maintaining balance)

Technical Stories:
-Rather than specifying image types manually, remove filter entirely or add ALL actual file types we support to filter
-More robust undo/redo system (current brute force approach is super slow)
	-Abstract undo/redo class 
	-Everything that can be undone/redone has instantiation
	-Two stacks for undo/redo; clear redo stack when pushing onto undo stack
-Odd visual bugs when resizing sheets sometimes
-Commandline argument support?

User stories:
-Test balance/resize; reports of crashing
-Arrange whole animation strips, perhaps via click first frame + Shift-click last frame + drag and drop? If not, clicking a row and using arrow buttons would suffice. (Current workaround: Use animation arrows)
-Being able to drag labels around
	-May want to think about labels being individual items rather than part of an animation
	-Along that note, custom labels & watermarks are common on TSR sheets
-Scroll sheet view when clicking and dragging frames around, particularly when zoomed in. For sheets that are long enough to where you have to zoom out a lot, this becomes necessary. (Current workaround: Shift-mousewheel or RMB)
-Being able to "anchor" frames by their bottoms instead of them all floating top-most within a strip where it's possible. This would make for a cleaner and frankly more accurate arrangement of animation frames in some instances. (Current workaround: balance animation)
-When I load lots of images (mainly that amount to a large sheet) it works fine but other times, loading... not the whole set at once, but in parts, causes it to freeze and crash.
	-See if image loading logic can be threaded or otherwise optimized to prevent all image loading on the main thread, causing UI hangs
-When a whole string/"animation" of sprites has been moved, the label gets removed instead of being carried along with it.
	-Might be a non-issue if moving animations as a whole? Should blank animations be allowed?
-Perhaps display sheet height?
	-Revisit workflow of optimal width/height vs. user-specified
-Figure out weird image formats in images Mighty Jetters uploaded, and see if my fault and/or can be fixed or not
	-Attempt loading images with FreeImage instead of QImage and see if FreeImage handles them better
-Offset frames by a few pixels l/r/u/d; not to be confused with moving frames around in an animation (Current workaround: use the balance animation button)
-Drag-and-drop should support .sheet file format
-Ctrl-Z appears to not work
-Create user guide? At the very least, a FAQ may help since e.g. the Balance Animation button isn't well understood
