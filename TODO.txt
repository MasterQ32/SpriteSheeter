Feature undoRedo:
-Check that applicable places are using UI mutex
-Add animation name back when undoing a delete
-Drag/drop and delete undo/redo should deselect all other frames

Release 1.2:
-Save/Save As should deal in .sheet format, PNG/etc should be Export
	-This way, users aren't misled into thinking they can re-open PNG images and such
-Unble to manually edit sheet width box due to min width constraints
-Remove red bg from selected anim; use outline or such

UI Design Stories:
-Drag-and-drop should support .sheet file format
	-Import sheet also support .sheet format. That way we can add frames from another .sheet to this one
-Bug: Animation preview doesn't reset when selecting new anim in sheet view
-Disable delete button if nothing selected
-Loading .sheet files should use loading mouse cursor (noticable when loading large files)
-Ctrl-A should select all
-Rework frame movement/editing:
	-Click-drag in box to select multiple frames
-Rework animation movement/editing:
	-Can click-drag animations around and between each other
-Add cut/copy/paste
	-Paste deselects everything else
	-Cut/copy disabled if nothing selected
	-Paste disabled if nothing in clipboard
-Add support to autocrop frames in an animation to remove whitespace (while maintaining balance)
-Different highlight box around last-selected frame for shift-click
-Odd scrollbars with empty sheets sometimes. Sheet view also lets you zoom in on empty sheet.

Technical Stories:
-Drag-drop failed by dragging frame to end of sheet?
-Only gen undo states if sheet wasn't empty at beginning? -- First attempt found that this wasn't straightforward; recommend closer look
-Rather than specifying image types manually, remove load filter entirely?
-Commandline argument support - That way we can associate .sheet with program
-Installer for ease of use / file association?
-Pull out functionality from sheet width & other slots; pull out into other functions that can be called elsewhere
-Odd visual bugs when resizing sheets sometimes -- probably a Qt bug/not worth looking into

User stories:
-Test balance/resize; reports of crashing (Possibly related to undo/redo memory cap? Research)
-Being able to drag labels around
	-May want to think about labels being individual items rather than an inherent part of an animation
	-Along that note, custom labels & watermarks are common on TSR sheets
-Scroll sheet view when clicking and dragging frames around, particularly when zoomed in. For sheets that are long enough to where you have to zoom out a lot, this becomes necessary. (Current workaround: Shift-mousewheel or RMB-drag)
-Being able to "anchor" frames by their bottoms instead of them all floating top-most within a strip where it's possible. This would make for a cleaner and frankly more accurate arrangement of animation frames in some instances. (Current workaround: balance animation)
-When I load lots of images (mainly that amount to a large sheet) it works fine but other times, loading... not the whole set at once, but in parts, causes it to freeze and crash.
	-See if image loading logic can be threaded or otherwise optimized to prevent all image loading on the main thread, causing UI hangs
	-Also see undo/redo memory cap story above
-When a whole string/"animation" of sprites has been moved, the label gets removed instead of being carried along with it.
	-Might be a non-issue if moving animations as a whole? Should blank animations be allowed?
-Perhaps display sheet height?
	-Revisit workflow of optimal width/height vs. user-specified
-Offset frames by a few pixels l/r/u/d; not to be confused with moving frames around in an animation (Current workaround: balance animation twice)
-Create user guide? At the very least, a FAQ may help since e.g. the Balance Animation button isn't well understood
-Auto-check for updates?
