v1.0:
-Select folders and apply defaults to create sheets from subfolders (Batch processing; see http://www.vg-resource.com/thread-27036-post-602625.html#pid602625)
-Test imageformats to see if they're needed for .jpeg and such
-Better responsiveness when click-dragging frames
-Commandline argument support


Other misc TODO:
-Animations extracted to their own class and rendered separately from one another
-Threaded rendering of animations
-Add debug log & test balance/resize; reports of crashing
-Offset frames by a few pixels l/r/u/d; not to be confused with moving frames around in an animation
-Rather than specifying image types manually, remove filter entirely or add ALL actual file types we support
-Update file case in repo
-Default w/h of balance window shouldn't be handled by MainWindow


NOTE:
-Users will need Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable (x86) https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145
